Features of Java

1. Simple
=> java is simple and easy to understand. The syntaxes are easy to learn
=> in c we have complex concepts like structures and pointers which is removed in java

2. Robust
=> java uses strong memory management

3. Security
=> an application developed using java is virus-free

4. Java is an object oriented Programming language(OOPs)
=> 4 pillars of OOPs are
=> Encapsulations
=> Inheritence
=> Polymorphism
=> Abstraction

5. Platform Independent
=> java is platform Independent
=> means we can run a java program written on one operating system to other operating system
=> if we write a java program in windows-11 then we can execute the same java program on windows10,
 macOS, or linux

6. Portable
=> it facilitates us to carry the code from one system to another system.

7. Multithreading
=> java supports Multithreading concepts
=> means different threads can be executed at the same time.

language => is a medium to communicate b/w two persons
Programming lang => a lang that is used to give a set of instruction to the system to execute 
                    a task is know as a Programming lang.

Types of Programming lang

1. High level lang(English like code)
=> a lang which is understandable by humans or programmers is known as HLL
=> ex. C, C++ , java

2. Low level lang(Binary Code)
=> a lang which is understandable by machine only is known as low level lang
=> binary lang is understandable by machine
=> binary lang means  a series of 0s and 1s

3. Mid level lang(Byte Code)
=> mid level lang helps us to convert high level lang to low level lang
=> mid level lang cannot be understandable by humans or machine
=> only JVM can understand mid level lang
